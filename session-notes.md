# Cloud Health Map - Session Notes

## Session 1 - September 6, 2025

### Session Overview
- **Duration**: ~30 minutes
- **Focus**: Project analysis and specification creation
- **Participants**: User + AI Assistant

### Accomplishments
1. **Repository Analysis**
   - Cloned existing cloud-health-map repository from GitHub
   - Analyzed current implementation (React + Vite + TypeScript)
   - Identified existing features: AWS RSS feed parsing, interactive map, Supabase integration

2. **Use Case Definition**
   - **Use Case 1**: Public AWS Health Monitor for GitHub Pages hosting
     - Free static hosting
     - Public AWS Status RSS feed
     - 5-10 minute refresh intervals
     - No authentication required
   
   - **Use Case 2**: Personal Health Dashboard integration
     - AWS account-specific health data
     - Personal Health Dashboard API
     - Real-time updates via EventBridge
     - IAM-based authentication

3. **Documentation Created**
   - PROJECT_SPECIFICATION.md with complete project overview
   - session-notes.md for tracking progress between sessions

### Current State
- **Repository**: Successfully cloned and analyzed
- **Dependencies**: Node.js not installed (blocked build process)
- **Architecture**: Identified dual-mode approach needed
- **Next Phase**: Core refactoring to remove Supabase dependencies

### Technical Findings
- Current implementation uses Supabase for real-time updates
- RSS feed URL: `https://status.aws.amazon.com/rss/all.rss`
- Refresh intervals: 15 minutes (normal), 5 minutes (errors)
- Map library: Leaflet.js with region markers
- UI framework: shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS

### Decisions Made
1. **Dual-mode architecture** with shared frontend components
2. **Phase-based development** approach (4 phases total)
3. **GitHub Pages** for public mode deployment
4. **AWS Lambda + EventBridge** for personal mode

### Issues Identified
- Supabase dependency blocks static hosting for Use Case 1
- Need mode detection system for configuration
- CORS potential issues with RSS feed fetching
- Node.js environment setup required for development

### Next Session Goals
1. Set up Node.js development environment
2. Begin Phase 1 refactoring:
   - Remove Supabase dependencies
   - Implement mode detection
   - Create configuration system
3. Test RSS feed fetching without backend
4. Prepare for GitHub Pages deployment

### Questions for Next Session
- Should we use a CORS proxy for RSS feeds?

### Development Workflow Established

#### **STANDARD PROCESS FOR TESTING CODE UPDATES**

**Step 1: Kill All Vite Servers**
```bash
pkill -f node && sleep 2
```

**Step 2: Start Fresh Server on Port 8080**
```bash
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm" && [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" && cd /mnt/c/CODE/cloud-health-map/versions/v2-static-github && nohup npm run dev -- --force --port 8080 > vite.log 2>&1 &
```

**Step 3: Verify Server Status**
```bash
cd /mnt/c/CODE/cloud-health-map/versions/v2-static-github && sleep 3 && tail -5 vite.log
```

**Step 4: Test Changes**
- Access: http://localhost:8080/cloud-health-map/
- Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+F5) to clear cache
- Test functionality

**Why This Process is Needed:**
- WSL file system can have caching issues with Vite hot reload
